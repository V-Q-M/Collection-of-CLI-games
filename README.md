# CLI games powered by Python and DuckDB

My simple command-line games written in Python, with a built-in scoreboard using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) as the embedded database.
The goal of this project was to learn how to integrate DuckDB inside of Python.

Supported games are:
- Chess
- Wordle
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Guess-the-number
